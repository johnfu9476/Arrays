     * Here are a few tips to know about this starter file.
     * 1. The function linearSearch is where you should write the linear search algorithm.
     * 2. A for-loop is a great way to iterate through each value in a list.
     * 3. the arrayName.Length method will return the length of an array, so if you are trying to iterate
     * through an entire array, this is a good starting place.
     * 4. if the value 'target' is not found in the array 'numbers', the function should return -1.
